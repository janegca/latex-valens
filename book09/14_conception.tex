\index{conception} \index{length of life}
The procedure which we explained previously in the discourse on conception <VI 9> must be applied: consider the \Moon’s degree-position at the delivery to be the Ascendant at the conception and the Ascendant at the delivery to be the \Moon’s position at the conception. 

Determine the length in days \textbf{/343P/} of the conception, and calculate with reference to the new and full moons and the remaining phases. 

<According to this> method, the Ascendant at the delivery will be in agreement.
