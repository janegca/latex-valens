\section{A Method for [Propitious and Impropitious] the Length of Life, with Reference to the Sun and the Moon.}
\index{length of life}
It occurs to me in connection with the preceding method (i.e. of 27 years) to append the 24 lunar cycles. Whenever this number can apply to a nativity, calculate as previously described. 

For infant nativities calculate as follows: make the \Moon\xspace the \textit{aphetic} point and assign 2 months 15 days to each sign.

Proceed to the contact of the \Moon\, or to the signs in trine or square, then to the ray-casting of the malefics\footnote{to an angle - marginal note [Riley]}, using the ray-casting closest to the total time of the nativityâ€™s basis. 

When the \Sun\xspace is the \textit{aphetic} point, assign 30 months to each sign. Carry out the operations as we prescribed when we outlined
the precise determination of the Lot, until the chronocratorship receives its total allotment of months and years.
