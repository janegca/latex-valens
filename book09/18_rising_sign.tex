\section{The Sign in the Ascendant, and the Required, Scientific Hour of Birth}

The appended table is constructed so as to give the sign in the Ascendant and the required, scientific hour of birth. It resembles the roughly accurate table which was constructed (in a puzzling manner) by the King, and which begins with the \Sunâ€™s position at the conception. 

I have constructed a precise table, starting with the month Thoth (which is odd because it is month /1), then with Phaophi (which is even because it is month /2), then Athyr (likewise odd), then Choiak (even). Then in sequence it is necessary to examine the remaining signs <=months> one by one. Enter the appended table at the day in question and at the operative month, and we will find for day or night nativities the hour of the birth on that same line.
