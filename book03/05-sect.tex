\section{The Sects of the Stars}

It is necessary to examine the sects of the stars: for day births the \Sun, \Jupiter, and \Saturn\xspace rejoice above the earth; for night births, below the earth. 

For night births the \Moon, \textbf{/134P/} \Mars, and \Venus\xspace rejoice above the earth; for day births below the earth. 

\Mercury\xspace rejoices according to the sect of the houseruler in whose terms the star is located. 

Consequently for day births, if a nativity is found to have \Jupiter, the \Sun, or \Saturn favorably configured above the earth, this will be better than having them below the earth.
Likewise $<$for night births$>$ it is advantageous if the nocturnal stars are found above the earth. \Venus\xspace
particularly rejoices when in the Ascendant or at MC; the rest rejoice in the Ascendant or Descendant.
