\section{Another Method from Critodemus about Hostile Places and Vital Sectors: from the Moon and the Ascendant.}

\textbf{/135P/}Whenever the Moon is found to be the apheta, one must observe the <contacts> and the points which are sextile, square, and in opposition to the Ascendant with reference to their rising times\footnote{Presumably to learn the years the points will be active.}. These will be considered as effective, especially when they are in signs of the same or equal rising times, signs of the same power, the listening or beholding signs, or the degrees of the antiscia. 

Likewise if the Ascendant is found to be the apheta, then it will be necessary to examine its distances <=aspects> with respect to the Moon according to rising times. My experience indicates that \textbf{/143K/} the fatal degrees\mn{Fatal Degrees} and the powerful degrees are those at MC, those at the Ascendant and the Moon by themselves, and those in opposition <to these points>. If they are at an angle, they have an extraordinary influence\footnote{Interesting that he is only concerned with the \Moon\, and Ascendant here; is it possible a similar relationship exists between the \Sun\, and MC??}.
