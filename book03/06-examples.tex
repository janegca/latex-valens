An example: \Sun\xspace in \Cancer\xspace 29° 30', \Moon\xspace in \Pisces\xspace 12°, \Saturn\xspace in \Sagittarius\xspace 27° 8', \Jupiter\xspace in \Capricorn\xspace 22° 13' <7°?>, \Mars\xspace in \Scorpio\xspace 7° 23', \Venus\xspace in \Cancer\xspace 28° 13', \Mercury\xspace in \Leo\xspace 11° 25',
Ascendant in \Pisces\xspace 17°, MC in \Sagittarius\xspace 25°
\footnote{\textit{Greek Horoscopes} dates the chart (L75) to approximately July 19, 75 AD (p.87)}.

\noindent The nativity was without a houseruler because \Venus,
the ruler of \textbf{/142K/} the terms of the \Moon\footnote{True if we take 12° as the 12th degree i.e. 11°; otherwise the \Moon\, is in \Jupiter's terms.}, had already set. 

The apheta was the Ascendant. 

\noindent \Mercury, the ruler of its <Ascendant’s> terms, was itself found just preceding the Descendant. Thus the vital sector
extends from the Ascendant to the point square <\Gemini\xspace 17°>, and to the projection of rays on the part of \Saturn\xspace into the point in opposition <to \Saturn: \Gemini 27°> to \Saturn, which is in the terms of a malefic <\Saturn>. \Mars\xspace deflected its diametrically opposite ray because \Jupiter\xspace was found in an equivalent degree and hindered the anaeretic influence\footnote{This is only true if \Jupiter\, really falls around 7 \Capricorn; where Pingree calculates it to be (GH p89).}. 

\newpage
The native died at age 69\footnote{Robert Hand calculated this using 20° acensions for \Pisces,  20° for \Aries, 25° for \Taurus, and 28° for \Gemini\, where the vital sector ends at 17 \Gemini: (13/30 x 20) + 20 + 24 + (17/30 x 28) = 8.67 + 20 + 24 + 15.87 = 68.54 $\approx$ 69 years.}, but if \Jupiter\xspace trine had not hindered <this malign influence>, he would have lived only 64 years.

Another example: \Sun\xspace in \Pisces\xspace 25° 8', \Moon\xspace in \Gemini\xspace 16° 53', \Saturn\xspace in \Pisces\xspace 1° 25', \Jupiter\xspace in
\Sagittarius\xspace 24° 18', \Mars\xspace in \Taurus\xspace 21° 8', \Venus\xspace in \Aquarius\xspace 9°, \Mercury\xspace in <\Aries 12°>, Ascendant in \Libra\xspace 15°, MC at \Cancer\xspace 16°
\footnote{\textit{Greek Horoscopes} dates the chart (L110) to approximately March 15, 110 AD (p.105)}.

\end{wrapfigure} 

The luminaries preceded the angles <MC Descendant>, the Ascendant was the apheta in the terms of \Jupiter, and \Jupiter\xspace was unfavorably situated\footnote{Because he was declining in the 3rd, not within the vital sector and in \Saturn's terms and square to him?}. The nativity lacked a houseruler, and the vital sector was <from the Ascendant> to \Scorpio\xspace 21°, the point in opposition to \Mars. \Mars, located in the aphetic terms <of \Jupiter>\footnote{Even though \Jupiter\, was not qualified to be houseruler his terms are still considered aphetic as he is still the term ruler of the \Moon, the chart's sect light.} and casting rays into the same terms, was the anaereta. The native died in his 51st year\footnote{Robert Hand worked this out using 40° for \Libra\, ascensions and 36° for \Scorpio\, (where \Mars's opposition falls) but it only works if we use 10 \Libra\, for the Ascendant, which Hand says Pingree suggests as editor of the original Greek text: 20/30 x 40° + 21/30 x 36° = 26.67 + 25.2 = 51.9 years (VRS3 p48).}

The aphetic\mn{Aphetic \& Anaeretic Terms} terms and the anaeretic terms (i.e. the terms of malefics) are not only those degrees in which the destructive stars are found or into which they cast their rays, but also those where the vital sector is in the beginning of the term <of a malefic>. In addition, it is necessary to calculate not only the chronocratorship of the sign which receives the ray, but also that of the sign which casts the ray, the sign in which the anaereta is found.
