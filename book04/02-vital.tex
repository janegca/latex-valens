\section{The Vital Sector}

For new-moon nativities, the $<$star$>$ located first after the new moon begins the vital sector, then the other stars as they come in the order of signs. 

For full-moon nativities, the $<$star$>$ following the full moon
serves the the same capacity. 

It is necessary to examine how the star is configured and which stars are in aspect. \textbf{/159K/} Also determine if the other stars that receive $<$the chronocratorship$>$ are at angles or precede angles, or are rising or setting. Determine the sequence of their transits and their sympathies and antipathies. 

After the 32 year 3 month period is completed, the second cycle is begun starting with the $<$next$>$ aphetic star of the one-fourth period.
