\section{The [XII] Place of the Bad Daimon. Many Configurations}
\index{places!12th}

If the malefics happen to be in this place, they will cause great wounds and traumas, especially if they are in their proper face. 
\index{lots!Fortune}
If the Lot of Fortune is present in this Place and some <star> rules it\footnote{VRS has ``and some [malefic] should have authority over it''}, there will be no help, not even during transits. \textbf{/61P/} They\footnote{\textit{[The Lot and its ruler? Or the ruler of the Lot and the ruler of the 12th?]}} have become enemies from the beginning, from the moment of birth. In the same, way benefics found in this Place will not bestow their benefits. 

Whenever these three stars fall in this sign (the rulers of the Ascendant, of the Lot, and of Daimon), they make men unfortunate and disgraced, those lacking their daily bread. Many will hold out their hands <for alms>.
