\section{The Exaltation of the Sun and Moon. Their Effects on Prosperity (18K,19P)}

We ourselves have found from experience a mystical way of calculating: for day births determine the distance from the \Sun\xspace at the nativity to \Aries, which is the \Sunâ€™s exaltation (for night births from the \Moon\xspace to \Taurus). <Count this> same distance from the Ascendant and examine the place where the count stops and its ruler. If it is found to be in the Ascendant or at MC, especially at an angle relative to the Lot, it
indicates a royal chart, provided the other stars and procedures point to a basis of greatness for the nativity. In addition, if the nativity is of high rank, and if the exaltation or the houseruler is favorably situated, the native will be exalted even beyond/to leadership, civil or royal office, or other distinguished positions of responsibility. 

If the basis of the nativity is average, and the ruler of the exaltation or the place itself is favorably situated, the native will be successful in the status to which he has been assigned: a craft, a science, or a talent. The houseruler itself and the sign will point out the type of good fortune to be expected, either from its own nature or from the sign in which it is located. Many times men have fared poorly in early life and have been in distress and gone astray, but later they have become lucky because of other factors. \textbf{/81K/}
