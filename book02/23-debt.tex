\section{The Lot of Debt (23K,24P)}
\index{lots!Debt}
If the Lot of Debt is <badly> situated or if its ruler is square or in opposition to it, with malefics beholding, in opposition, or in superior aspect, this Lot makes nativities debtors. 

The Lot of Debt is calculated \mn{Calc.} by determining the distance from \Mercury\, to \Saturn\, then counting that same distance from the Ascendant. 

From the Lots located in this place, or from the stars in conjunction <with Accomplishment>, opposition, or square with this Lot, the fate of the nativeâ€™s property will be obvious.\mndl The same conclusions can be drawn from the stars in conjunction with Fortune, with Daimon, with Accomplishment,
or from the Lots coinciding with them, and from their rulers.

Particularly examine the Lot of Deceit and the Lot of Theft to see if they have some relationship with Accomplishment, Fortune, Daimon, or Life, or any relationship with the rulers of these Lots. It is possible that those <stars> which bring possessions derived from these unwholesome activities, have no relationship <with those places>. 

If \mndl the places just mentioned \textbf{/91K/} have no relationship with Accomplishment, Life, Fortune, or Daimon, <the Lot of Debt> ruins the livelihood of the native and his property. If they do have such a relationship, \textbf{/87P/} you will find that his property comes from crime, deceit, plots, force, theft, and violence.
