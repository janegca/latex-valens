\section{The Loss of Parents (32K,33P)}

\Mars\xspace in conjunction with the \Sun\xspace and \Square\xspace with \Saturn\xspace causes bereavement. 

\Saturn\xspace and \Mars\xspace configured with \Mercury, if \Jupiter\xspace is not in aspect on the right, likewise make orphans. 

\Saturn\xspace setting with \Jupiter\xspace makes orphans. 

The \Moon\xspace in a bicorporeal sign and with \Jupiter\xspace in aspect indicates children with two fathers. 

If \Venus\xspace is in the Ascendant, \textbf{/104K/} and if the \Moon\xspace is at IC, in the house of \Mars, and if \Jupiter\xspace is in unfavorable aspect and out of its own houseâ€”this too will make children who have two fathers.

The character of the parents can be determined from the stars which are configured together. \Saturn\xspace will show them to be surly, envious, depraved, suspicious, foul, involved in secret passions, ugly, spending their money on religious matters, friends of great lords. 

\Jupiter\xspace will show them to be lovers of the good, illustrious, generous, frank and open, cheerful. 

\Mars\xspace will show them to be bold, \textbf{/99P/} hot tempered, rash, insolent, reckless, restless, risking all, drunkards, toilsome. (Concerning mothers: if \Mars\xspace
as houseruler overpowers the \Moon\xspace or \Venus, it shows the mother to be rough, a whore, troubled acutely by bleeding or consumption, if no benefic in aspect relieves the situation.) 

\Venus\xspace in aspect with the luminaries shows the parents to be cheerful, musical, fond of good cheer, affectionate, religious. 

\Mercury\xspace shows them to be joiners, sociable and thrifty, sharers in some account or skill, lying most of the time and
wronging their inferiors.

$<$When making this determination about parents$>$ it is necessary to consider the places $<$of the stars$>$
as well: the \Sun\xspace in a masculine sign and having a masculine star in aspect shows the father to be noble; in a
feminine sign and having the \Moon\xspace in aspect shows him to be slack and effeminate. 

The \Sun\xspace in a feminine sign and having \Saturn\xspace or \Venus\xspace in aspect shows the father to be not unharmed and not without a bad reputation. 

The \Moon\xspace in a feminine sign and having feminine stars in aspect shows the mother to be dictatorial and wrathful; in a masculine sign and with masculine stars in aspect, it shows the mother to be hot-tempered and uncontrollable; in a feminine sign and having \Jupiter\xspace in aspect, it shows the mother to be mild and kindly.
