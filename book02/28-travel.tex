\section{Travel, from Hermippos (28K,29P)}

The difficult topic of travel has not been treated either by Petosiris\mn{Petosiris} or by the learned King in his treatises, except in this fashion: \begin{quote}If a malefic has a phase in this chronocratorship, it will cause travel and vexation for the nativity.\end{quote} This is the truth, but they have nothing more than this to say about the Place of Foreign Lands\footnote{Schmidt says ``they have nothing else on the subject of foreign lands'' (VRS2 p55).}. 

The most amazing Abraham has shown us in his books other astrologersâ€™ explanations of the Place, as well as his own, since he found and proved additional <secrets/interpretations>, especially concerning expatriate nativities, with the following results: when \Mars\xspace beholds the setting luminaries or the Lot of Fortune, if that Lot just precedes MC, or <when \Mars\xspace beholds> the \Moon\xspace or most of the stars at IC, <it causes nativities to travel>. 

If the ruler of Fortune is found in the Lot or Place of Foreign Lands or in opposition to it, or indeed if Fortune itself is located there in the Lot of Travel\footnote{No formula given as yet. Firmicus gives it as ``from the \Sun\, to \Mars\, and again from the ascendant'' (AATPB 6.32.49) }, and \textbf{/92P/} if \Mars\xspace is in conjunction with the Lot or beholds that Place, this too causes nativities to travel. The same is true <if \Mars\xspace beholds> Fortune and Daimon.
