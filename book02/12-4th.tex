\index{planets!benefics}
If benefics rule the Ascendant or Fortune, and are in this Place, the native will make his living in temples. 

If benefics are assigned the Archetypal Lot\footnote{The Lot of Fortune.}, and are houserulers at Lower Midheaven, the native will be given revelations by gods and through visions of ghostly shapes. 

\index{planets!Mars}
If Mars is here with them and is assigned Fortune and the Ascendant, the native will live a troubled life, disgraced, falling into difficulties,
engaged in criminal activity with others, and suffering a violent/self-inflicted death.

\index{planets!malefics}
It must be observed that this Place implies good repute after death and bequests to heirs. If malefics are in this Place, the native will bequeath his property to whomever he wishes.
