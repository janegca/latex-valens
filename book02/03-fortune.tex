\section{The Lot of Fortune and its Houseruler}
\index{lots!Fortune}
Since I want to make the topic of good fortune most secure and precise, I am moving on to the Lot of Fortune, the most influential and most potent place. Just as the King has mystically revealed in the beginning of his XIIIth Book: \mnt “Next in order, it will be necessary (for day nativities) to count accurately the distance from the \Sun\, to the \Moon, then to measure off in the opposite direction an equal distance from
the Ascendant, and to inspect the resulting place: which star is its ruler and which star or stars are at this point and all the square or trine asterisms of this place. From this study/combination of the places, make a clear determination of the natives’ affairs.”

\textbf{/60K/} In his book, \textit{The Terms}, Petosiris\mn{Petosiris} explains this place in the same way. Others treat this subject
in other ways, ways which we will publish when necessary, along with other methods which clarify the topic of good fortune. Now we must speak about the matter at hand.
