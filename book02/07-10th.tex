\section{[The X Place]---Midheaven}

Both benefics and malefics rejoice in this place if they have been assigned the Lot, the Ascendant, or Daimon. 

If any of the $<$benefics$>$ are in it when rising, or if they have contact with the \Moon, tyrants and kin[g]s are born, governors of districts, men known by name in many places. 

The ruler of this Place, if situated favorably, makes vigorous/successful men; if situated unfavorably, it makes feeble/unsuccessful men. 

If $<$the ruler$>$ is setting and a malefic is in conjunction or in opposition to this Place, it makes failures, as well as sterile or childless men.\textbf{/62P/}
