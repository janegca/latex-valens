\section{The VIII Place of Death. Various Views (8K,9P)}

Benefics appearing in this place are ineffectual and weak, and they do not bestow their proper benefits. If in addition they rule the Ascendant and the Lot of Fortune, they are even more ineffectual and variable. If malefics are in conjunction and rule the Lot, the native is a vagrant, losing whatever he may have gained.

If the Lot falls in this Place and if malefics are in conjunction and are houserulers of the Lot, the native will be poor, unable to clothe himself. If <malefics> also rule the Ascendant, he will be abject his whole life. If the houseruler of the Lot or of the Ascendant is under the rays of the \Sun, the native will stretch out his hands to beg. 

If Mercury alone is in this Sign and is ruler of Intelligence (as Daimon is called), it makes fools, dullards, those handicapped in speech, illiterates. \textbf{/63P/}

If Fortune <is there>, the native, besides being dull, will also be stupid and poor, especially if <the Lot> is under the \Sun's rays. If under these circumstances malefics are also in conjunction, the native will be deaf and dumb. Only the Moon, when its light is waxing, seems to rejoice in this Place.
