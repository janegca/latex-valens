\section{The Triangles \textit{[Triplicities]}}

When the zodiacal circle is subdivided according to similarities and differences, we find two sects, solar and lunar, day and night.

\marginnote{Fire \\ \Aries-\Leo-\Sagittarius}[0.2cm]
The \Sun, being fiery, is most related to \Aries, \Leo, and \Sagittarius, and this triangle of the \Sun\, is called “of the day-sect” because it too is fiery by nature. The \Sun\, has attached \Jupiter\, and \Saturn\, to this sect as his co-workers and guardians of the things which he accomplishes: \Jupiter\, as a reflection of the \Sun\, and as his successor to the kingship, a partisan of good, and the bestower of glory
and life, \Saturn\, on the other hand as a servant of evil and of downfall, and a depriver of years <of life>. Therefore the \Sun\, is the lord of this triangle for day births; for night births \Jupiter\, succeeds to the throne; \Saturn\, works with both.

\marginnote{Earth \\ \Taurus-\Virgo-\Capricorn}[0.2cm]
Next the Moon, being near the earth, is allotted the house rulership of \Taurus, \Virgo, and \Capricorn, a triangle earthy in nature and the next in order. It has \Venus\, and \Mars\, as members of the same sect: \Venus\,
(as is reasonable) acts as a benefactor and distributes glory and years; \textbf{/56K/} \Mars\, acts as the bane of
nativities. Therefore for night births the \Moon\, has preeminence; in the second place is \Venus; in the third
is \Mars. For day births \Venus\, will lead; the \Moon\, will operate second; \Mars, third.

\index{triplicities!air}
\textbf{/55P/}\marginnote{Air \\ \Gemini-\Libra-\Aquarius}[0.2cm] Next is the airy triangle of \Gemini, \Libra, and \Aquarius. For day births \Saturn\, will rule this;
\Mercury\, will operate second; \Jupiter, third. For night births \Mercury\, will lead; \Saturn\, will come second; \Jupiter, third.

\index{triplicities!water}
\marginnote{Water \\ \Cancer-\Scorpio-\Pisces}
In the same fashion, next is the moist triangle of \Cancer, \Scorpio, and \Pisces. \Mars\, will have the house rulership for night births; in the second place is \Venus; in the third the \Moon. For day births \Venus\, will lead; after it comes \Mars; then the \Moon.

Note that Mercury is common and works with the two sects to a special degree to accentuate the good or the bad, and to accentuate the individual characteristics and configurations of each star.
