\section{The VI Place. The Place of Mars (10K,11P)}

If benefics happen to be in this Place, the native will lose whatever he possesses; his property will not stay with him. \textbf{/64P/} He will suffer loss because of fines when advanced in years. 

If the Sun is in this Place and rules the Lot of Fortune or the Ascendant, it causes the native to be condemned by the highest authority. 

If Saturn rules <these places>, the native will be a wanderer, prone to give offense, and he will flee his homeland, barely keeping himself alive. 

If Jupiter rules the Lot or the Ascendant, the native will lose his property in civil suits. 

If Venus rules, he will suffer trials and penalties because of a woman. Such men, being disagreeable, are insensible to love. 

If Mars rules, it causes wounds and diseases \textbf{/66K/} in the limb indicated by the sign <where Mars is>, and it makes naked beggars who come to a miserable end. 

If Mercury rules the Lot or the Ascendant, it makes plotters, thieves, slanderers, and men who are reviled in
public. 

If the Moon is in this Place, the native will be a slave, helplessâ€”unless the rest are in conjunction with the \Moon: if the other stars are situated favorably, the native can be free and respectable, even though the \Moon\xspace is in <the VI Place of> Bad Fortune.
