If  \Saturn\, is allotted the hour\footnote{The delineations are meant to hold for \textit{any planet} ruling the Ascendant (the ``hour'' marker), or the Lot of Fortune, or any planet physically located in the Ascendant (1st House).} of the Lot <of Fortune> and is in the Ascendant, with \Mars\, not in opposition, the native will be fortunate in activities controlled by \Saturn. \textbf{/59P/} If \Jupiter\, is in aspect, he will be doubly fortunate; if \Venus\, is in aspect, he will be fortunate through the help of women or eunuchs. If \Mars\, is in conjunction or in opposition, the native will suffer disturbance and reversals. If \Mercury\,
shares the Ascendant with \Saturn, the native will be handicapped in his hearing.

\Jupiter, when allotted the hour or the Lot and in the Ascendant, causes men to be very fortunate from youth. If \Mars\, is in configuration (at the same center or in trine), men will advance by means of brilliant campaigns and will win the acquisition of a livelihood. If \Saturn\, is also in aspect, men become exalted; if \Venus\, is in aspect, they become even more exalted. If \Mercury\, is in aspect, men are involved in exchanges.

\Mars, when allotted the hour or the Lot and in the Ascendant, urges men toward the military. If \Jupiter\, is in aspect, the native advances in status; if \Venus\, is, he attains an extraordinary status. If \Mercury\, is in conjunction, he will accept a deposit given without witnesses, but will later deny it. If \Jupiter\, is in conjunction, he will acquire much property from many people, but after his death it will all revert to the royal treasury.

\Venus, when allotted the hour or the Lot <and in the Ascendant>, indicates great good and makes men far-renowned. If \Mercury\, is in conjunction, it makes musicians. But if, given the preceding configuration, \Saturn\, is in opposition to them or is in a superior aspect, it robs men of what they have.

\Mercury, when allotted the hour or the Lot and in the Ascendant, makes men fortunate. If \Jupiter\, is inconjunction or square, men will have control of tribunals and cities. If \Saturn\, is in conjunction as well, the control, honors, goods, and success will be double. \textbf{/61K/}

The \Sun\, inheriting the hour or Fortune and in the Ascendant: if \Jupiter\, is in conjunction or square, the native will be fortunate. If \Mercury\, is also in conjunction, he will succeed through his words. If \Mars\, is in conjunction or square along with \Jupiter, the native will be great, a master of life and death. If, given the previous configuration, \Saturn\, is square or in opposition, the native will fall into mishaps and penalties.

The \Moon, when inheriting the hour or the Lot of Fortune <and in the Ascendant>, makes men great, especially when it is in its own triangle. If \Venus\, is in conjunction or square, the native will be thought worthy of great honor. If \Mars\, is also with the \Moon, he will be master of life and death. If \Saturn\, is, he will control many districts.\textbf{/60P/} If \Jupiter\, is in conjunction or square, they will be great kings. If none of the above is the case, and if \Mercury\, is configured with the \Moon, success will be from words and special aptitudes. If \Mars\, is also in conjunction or square, it makes tyrants and great lords. If \Mars\, is in opposition to the \Moon, with no benefics in aspect, the child will be exposed; but if a benefic is in aspect, the exposed child will survive and be reared. Likewise if \Mars\, appears in square or is found in a superior aspect, it entangles the native in wanderings, separations, and vicissitudes. But if \Venus\, is in square at an angle, men will be wronged by women. If \Saturn\, is in conjunction in a lewd sign, men will be pimps, and if \Mars\, is also in the configuration, then men will hire their wives out to others. If \Saturn\, is square with the \Moon\, or is in \mned exact opposition (to the degree) to [\Saturn], the native will have an interruption of nurture and will be abandoned by his parents. If \Mercury\, is square or in opposition to the \Moon, men will be contrary-minded, always in opposition, involved in slanders and accusations from a superior. If, in addition, a malefic is in the aspect or in the configuration, it will bring discredit and condemnation. \Jupiter\, lying \mned exactly opposite the \Moon\, causes sterility \textbf{/62K/} and the opposition of superiors.

In general, malefics which behold the luminaries and the Ascendant with no benefics <in aspect> make men short-lived. If the ruler of the Ascendant lies in its proper place or in its own sect, it becomes the bestower of <long> lifespans. If it is configured with the lord of the Lot <of Fortune>, the native becomes full of years and luck. If the ruler happens to be setting, the native becomes short-lived. If a malefic is in conjunction or in superior aspect with the \Moon, the infants will not survive.
