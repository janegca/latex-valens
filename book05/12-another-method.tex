\section{Another Method For the Critical Years: Critodemus Begins with the Moon (12K,8P)}

\index{distribution!years}
An example: \Sun\, in \Aquarius, \Moon\, in \Leo, \Saturn\, in \Cancer, \Jupiter\, in \Gemini, \Mars\, in \Scorpio, \Venus\, in \Aries, \Mercury\, in \Pisces\footnote{\textit{Greek Horoscopes} dates the chart to February 11, 92 CE. No Ascendant is given by Valens, GH puts the Ascendant at sunrise; Schmidt used \Aries as the Ascendant.}

\noindent\textbf{/235K/} The 12 years <are derived from> \Mars’s distance of 4 signs <from the \Moon>. The critical year is simple, because 4x4=16. (The squares are simple; the rectangular numbers are composite.) The 18 for \Venus\, is composite: 2x9. The 2 <is from \Leo> to \Virgo, but no star is in \Virgo, so \Venus\, is 9 signs from the \Moon. \textbf{/224P/} If there were a star in \Virgo, it <\Venus> would have returned because of the…

Since 3x6=18, we investigate this figure too. However, no star is in \Libra, the third sign <from the \Moon>, or in \Capricorn, the sixth.

Next 20 is composite, because 4x5=20, and 5x4=20. So \Mars\, in \Scorpio\, <the fourth sign> is operative; no star is in \Sagittarius, the fifth sign.

3x7=21: no star is in \Libra\, <the third sign>, but the \Sun\, is in \Aquarius <the seventh>. So <the return> is to the \Sun.

4x6=24: again \Mars\, is in \Scorpio\, <the fourth sign>, but no star is in \Capricorn\, <the sixth>.

25 is square, a simple number, but no star is in \Sagittarius\, <the fifth sign>.

3x9=27: no star is at the third interval, only \Venus\, in the ninth <\Aries>.

28 is composed of 4 (the return to \Mars) and 7 (the return to the \Sun).

4x10=40 and 5x8=40: this is associated with \Mars, because of the 4, and with \Mercury\, because of the 8.

<4x11=> 44: this is associated with \Mars\, and \Jupiter.

 Sometimes several stars return to the same point together, as in the case of 40, because \Mars\, lies in the fourth sign and \Mercury\, in the eighth. If some star had been in the tenth and the fifth signs, they would also have returned together there.
 
 He says that outcomes will be more vigorous and obvious if the number of the year is the same as the number appropriate to the intervals between stars, as follows\footnote{Schmidt says ``we don't know the source of these special numbers'' (VRS5 p.54)}:
 
 \begin{table}[ht]
 \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l r l r}
\hline
\Saturn & 3 & \Jupiter & \textsl[9\footnote{The Riley text shows 10 but Neugebauer and Schmidt both give 9.}] \\
\Venus & 5 & \Moon & 13 \\
\Mars & 7 & \Sun & 18 \\
\Mercury & 8 \\
 \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \end{center}
 \end{table}

If the number and the interval coincide at the same star, the star will be operative in an operative sign. 

If the year-number does not coincide with any of the intervals applicable to the star, it will be inoperative in an inoperative sign. 

If one interval is found to be operative, but another interval does not occur in the subsequent years, the initial interval must be used until another is found. 

Using the preceding horoscope as an example: 28 is associated with \Mars\, and the \Sun\, <4 and 7>. 29 has no interval. 30 has 3, 5, 6, and 10: these signs too are empty. 31 again is not associated with any interval. Therefore \Mars\, and \textbf{/236K/} the \Sun, operative in the 28th year, control the succeeding years until the 32nd year, when \Mars\, (because of the 4) and \Mercury\, (because of the 8) have mutual returns. 

We will append the differences of the critical years according to the chronocratorships of the stars and their mutual returns to each other.

An example: \Sun, \Jupiter, \Mars\, in \Cancer, \Moon\, in \Libra, \Saturn\, in \Sagittarius, \Venus, \Mercury\, in
\Leo, Ascendant in \Gemini\footnote{\textit{Greek Horoscopes} dates the chart to July 17, 104 CE about 4 a.m.}.

The native died in his 54th year. The cycle was at the 18th critical point of \Saturn, the sixth of \Jupiter, the third of the \Sun\footnote{Neugebauer says these values come from the planets special numbers given earlier: \Saturn\, = 3, \Jupiter\, = 9, \Sun\, = 18. The age of 54 = 18 x 3 = 6 x 9 = 3 x 18 (GH p.102).}, i.e. the mutual returns of these stars. The \Sun\, and \Jupiter\, were found in the death-bringing month, \Sagittarius. In addition the \Sun, \Jupiter, and \Mars\, transmitted the 54th year from the <8th> Place of Death <relative to the Lot of Fortune>\footnote{This is a nocturnal chart so Fortune would be from the \Moon\, to the \Sun\, which is 10 signs, so Fortune would fall in the 10th sign from the Ascendant, \Pisces, with the 8th from Fortune falling in \Libra\, where the \Moon\, sits. Were the \Sun, \Jupiter\, and \Mars\, transiting the \Moon\ while transmitting to \Saturn ?} to \Saturn\, in \Sagittarius. Such a transmission was grievous.

\textbf{/228P/} In every nativity it seems right to put the start of the critical points not just at the \Moon, but at all of the stars from whose <positions and nature> the fatal times and life-threatening troubles can be determined. If the life-giving chronocrators take effect—this is determined by using these methods—the critical point will occur without any doubt. 

If the basis of the nativity has a continuation <of life>, \textbf{/238K/} but the critical point falls at that time, a crisis will occur with respect to actions and types of livelihoods: loss of rank, ruin, violence, convictions, shipwreck, trials, imprisonment, exile, anxieties, losses,
penalties, sudden dangers, threats, robbery, plus whatever crises arise in man’s life: injuries, diseases, amputations of the extremities, burns, cuts, illnesses, dangerous plots. 

If the stars which have critical points and which are mutually returning are found to be in opposition, beheld by malefics, and located out
of their own sect at the nativity, they indicate that the period will be precarious and troublesome. But if they are in an appropriate configuration, they weaken the onset of the crisis and make the critical point milder in its effects. 

The transmissions or receptions from signs of equal rising time must be considered active: from \Aries\, to \Pisces, from \Taurus\, to \Aquarius, from \Gemini\, to \Capricorn, from \Cancer\, to \Sagittarius, from \Leo\, to \Scorpio, and from \Virgo\, to \Libra. The same is true in reverse order.

These facts we have tested with sober reasoning and much careworn toil; we have expounded them with great labor for those who have the necessary intelligence. <We hoped> to be able to equal both in
achievement and in fame what the sages of old accomplished when they devoted themselves to this art. But as it is, those who bastardize this science with fancy words and complicated schemes find it easy to
persuade not only those who are uninitiated into this art but also those who have something to boast of and who have a great reputation. Their success in persuading comes from the fact that their wizardry and effrontery is hard to grasp. Such men do not consider errors to be setbacks and they are successful in their brazenness, since they do not have blushes as the refutation of their ignorance. Instead they strut the stage like tragic or comic characters, walking in the ways of deceit, not of truth. 

But the man who has started with rules and theorems does not wish to bring disrepute on the knowledge which he gained with such difficulty, and so he leans on his experience as on a staff, \textbf{/229P/} and he answers slowly and hesitantly, and he is not driven <?> from his purpose, because he considers that a mistake is worthy of exile or death, but that a success is the “toilsome heart \textbf{/239K/} of virtue.” This <error> occurs with respect to the ignorant or those who do not precisely calculate the year or the hour.<?>

So it would be necessary for those wishing to hear with special confidence about the present or the future to judge carefully these men and to praise any of their deeds, so that the prognosticator, having grasped the precise effects of the angles and of the powerful places using specific numbers and a definite system, may forecast the truth.

For often (as I have said) not only have these deceptive men and their spiritual fathers falsified the times and wronged our science; I have learned this from my spiritual ancestors as well. But they do this
since they wished in one moment to hear things which are in accord with their desires and are mixed <with honor>, and to be involved with impossible things by means of some wicked magic art. After they have learned from the ignorant and done with enthusiasm what they should not have done, they then enjoy praise and honors, and repay their enemies: they revile honored men, the experienced <astrologers>, on the grounds that they cannot easily make forecasts nor compose treatises in detail. They do not know that the
details of each nativity are grasped only with much labor and investigation. Later thay fail in their expectations, and they not only repent and bring censure in a precarious and painful way on their own
falsehoods, but they also call this science “unreal” and consider its practitioners as enemies. Thus it happens that this science has been dishonored in the eyes of the public by a few men unworthy of it.
