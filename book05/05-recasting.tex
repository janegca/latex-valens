\section{The Recasting of a Horoscope with Reference to the Topic of Propitious and Impropitious [Times]}

We consider the recasting of horoscopes to be essential because the recasting contributes greatly to the temporal interchange of the chronocrators. Sometimes the recasting increases the strength of the results, sometimes it is indicative of delays in the results. 

After we calculate precisely the positions of the stars on the birth date in the current year, we will find the Ascendant as follows: while the \Sun\xspace is still in the natal sign, we examine where the \Moon\xspace was then and when the \Moon\xspace will come to the exact same degree where it was at the nativity, and we call that point the Ascendant. If that exact degree is found to be during the day, even though the nativity was nocturnal, we examine the diurnal houserulers, the ruler of the term, and
of the Ascendant in order to find their relationships to the stars at the nativity.
