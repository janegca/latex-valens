\index{distribution!10-year, 9-month!months}
The third stage subdivision is done as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*]
\item \Saturn\, rules 2 years 6 months. It will transmit
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item to itself 6 months, 29 days, 6 1/4 hours.
		\item to \Jupiter\xspace 2 months, 23 days, 17 1/3 hours.
		\item to \Mars\xspace 3 months, 14 days, 15 2/3 hours.
		\item to the \Sun\xspace 4 months, 12 days, 13 5/12 hours.
		\item to \Venus\xspace 1 month, 25 days, 19 1/2 hours.
		\item to \Mercury\xspace 4 months, 19 days, 12 2/3 hours.
		\item to the \Moon\xspace 5 months, 24 days, 10 hours. \\
	\end{enumerate}
	\vspace{-1em}
