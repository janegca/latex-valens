\section{Transits (4K,5P)}

\index{delineation!transits}
The transits of the stars are considered vigorous when the masters of the chronocratorships transit the Places, or are in opposition or square with them. For instance, when each of those stars which hold the rule and leadership makes a transit in its allotted hour, it acts vigorously to save or to destroy: no man, however great he happens to be in family, livelihood, or rank, can block either its threats or its benefits for anyone. The person will yield to the laws of the occasion until the star abdicates its rule. When the star completes its chronocratorship, it transmits the governance to another and resumes its ineffectiveness for either good or bad. 

The methods of determining the effects of transmissions, the combinations of interrelated aspects, and the effect of conjunctions have been explained by us previously. These methods must be used, since each star acts in accord with its own nature and the applicable chronocratorship to
show the type of result to be expected.
