\Venus: the third, the seventh, and the eighth are good; the fifth is rotten.

\Mercury: the second, the fifth, and the eleventh are rotten; the seventh, the eighth, and the ninth are good.

\mndl[0.2cm]
The other <numbers> of each star are variable in effect.
If the stars are in the previously mentioned places in their transits, particularly when they hold the chronocratorship in operative places, with benefics or malefics in aspect, then they are bestowers of good or evil depending on whichever aspect prevails. 

\mnm[0.3cm]
If the <benefics and malefics> are together, a mixture of good and bad will ensue according to the quality of each person’s nativity. Therefore it is always necessary to
observe the places with respect to <the stars’> transits in order to evaluate the chronocratorships.]

Let us append the associations and combinations of each star.\enlargethispage{2\baselineskip}\footnote{Mars is listed in combination under each planet but not on his own. His combinations with the \Sun\xspace and \Moon\xspace are missing from the text.}

\subsection{\textit{[Saturn]}}

When \Saturn\xspace and \Jupiter\xspace are together, they are in agreement with each other, and they bring about benefits from legacies and adoptions, and they cause men to be masters of property consisting of land, to be guardians, managers of others’ property, stewards, and tax gatherers.

\Saturn\xspace and \Mars\xspace are hostile, productive of reversals and ruin. They bring family quarrels, disharmony,
and hatred, along with treachery, plots, malevolence, and trials. However, if these stars are not in their own or in operative signs, and if they have benefics in aspect, they produce distinguished and noble nativities, although unsteady in their happiness and prone to unexpected dangers and treachery.

\textbf{/37P/}\Saturn\xspace and \Mercury\xspace are allies and productive of activities/employment. They do, however, bring slanders about religion, lawsuits, and debts, as well as disturbances about written matters and money. On the other hand, these stars make men who are not without resources and not unintelligent, with much experience and awareness, and who are curious, far-seeing scholars, seekers after mystic lore,
revering the gods, but with much on their consciences.

\Saturn\xspace and \Venus\xspace act harmoniously with respect to activities/employment: \textbf{/38K/} they promote success with respect to entanglements and marriage, agreeing and beneficial only for a time, not to the end. Indeed they cause abuse, divorces, inconstancy, and death, often entangling men with the base-born and the lowly, and causing them to fall into harm and lawsuits.

\Saturn\xspace and the \Moon\xspace are beneficial, productive of money, estates, ship ownership, and profits from the deceased, \mndl especially if the \Moon\xspace happens to be in the part of its orbit just following first visibility and has benefics in aspect. Then it causes association with the great, gifts, and the discomfiture of enemies. This combination, however, is unsteady with respect to possession, and with respect to women it is insecure and painful because of separations, hatred, and grief. It also produces bodily suffering, sudden fits, pains of
the governing faculties and nerves, as well as the deaths of important figures.

\Saturn\xspace and the \Sun\xspace are at odds, giving and taking away possessions and friendships maliciously. Therefore those born under such a juncture suffer secret enmities and threats from great persons and are plotted against by some and live hated to the end. Playing their part well, they outlive most <of their enemies>. They are, however, not without resources, but are disturbed and long-suffering. They are self controlled in this onslaught of reversals.

\secbr
\subsection{\textit{[Jupiter]}}
When \Jupiter\xspace and the \Sun\xspace are together, they produce noble and distinguished men, rulers, governors,
dictators, vigorous men, honored and blessed by the crowd. These men are wealthy, rich, living with much spectacle. Sometimes however they are involved in uncertainties and \textbf{/38P/} hostility. Especially if the star <\Jupiter> is found to be setting, they resort to greater showiness and make a pretense of the truth.

\Jupiter\xspace and the \Moon\xspace are good, acquisitive: they cause men to be masters of adornments and slaves, and they bestow distinguished offices and ranks. They cause men to benefit from women and distinguished individuals, to be treated well by family and children, and to be thought worthy of gifts and honors. They make treasurers, men who lend much, who are trusted, and who find treasures and become wealthy.

\textbf{/39K/}\Jupiter\xspace and \Mars\xspace make glorious and showy characters, friends of the great or of kings,
distinguished governors and receivers of stipends, those making a career in public affairs or in campaigns, and those considered worthy of honor and status, but uncertain in their livelihoods and habits, tossing away their possessions.

\Jupiter\xspace and \Venus\xspace are good, in harmony, productive of rank and profits, bringing new acquisitions,
gifts, adornments, control over slaves, rulerships, the begetting of children, high priesthoods, preeminence among the masses, honors of garlands and gold crowns. These stars make men who are worthy of statues and images, but they also make them subject to ups and downs with respect to marriages and children.

\Jupiter\xspace and \Mercury\xspace are good, in harmony, and supervisory. They make men who are managers, overseers of affairs, in posts of trust and administration. They make men who are successful as secretaries and accountants and who are respected in education. These are approachable people with many friends, judged worthy of pay and stipends. If \Jupiter\xspace and \Mercury\xspace are found in operative signs, they make men
discoverers of treasures, or moneylenders who profit from cash deposits.

\secbr
\subsection{\textit{[Venus]}}
\Venus\xspace and the \Sun\xspace are in harmony, glorious, bestowers of good. They cause the association of male and female, they bring gifts and conveyances, and make men successful in their enterprises. Occasionally they make those men who take on popular leadership or trusts, those who are in charge of foreign/secure places, those thought worthy of stipends. These men, however, are not without grief with respect to wife and children, especially if Venus is setting.

\textbf{/39P/}\Venus\xspace and the \Moon\xspace are good with respect to rank, acquisitions, and the inception of business,
but they are unsteady with respect to living together, friendships, and marriage, bringing rivalry and hostility, as well as ill-treatment and upset from relatives and friends. Likewise with respect to children and slaves, these stars are not good: they cause possessions to be fleeting and bring mental anguish.

\Venus\xspace and \Mars\xspace are at odds. They make men unsteady and weak of mind; they cause rivalry and murder; they cause men to have many friends, but to be blameworthy, shameless, fickle, and equally prone to intercourse with men or women; to be malicious, and plotters of murder by poison. These stars cause men to remain with neither the good nor the bad, to be slandered and reviled because of their friendships, to
be spendthrift, \textbf{/40K/} flitting from one occupation to another, to be eager for many things, to be wronged by women and because of them to suffer crises, upsets, and debts.

\Venus\xspace and \Mercury\xspace are in harmony. They make men sociable and gracious, gregarious and hedonistic, paying attention to education and sensibility, receiving honors and gifts. For those of mediocre fortune, these stars bring about the receiving of goods, selling, and exchanges, and they bring a base livelihood. These stars make men unsteady and fickle with respect to women, changeable in their agreements <with
them>.

\secbr
\subsection{\textit{[Mercury]}}
\Mercury\xspace and the \Sun\xspace make adaptable men with many friends, those flexible and self-controlled men who spend their careers in public places. These stars make pure, sensible men, men of good judgment, lovers of beauty, learned men, initiates into divine matters, beneficent, fond of their associates, independent, braggarts. These men endure reversals nobly, but are ineffective, suffering ups and downs in their
livelihoods, experiencing vicissitudes. They are not poverty-stricken, but find a success proportional to the basis of their nativities.

\textbf{/40P/}\Mercury\xspace and the \Moon\xspace are good with respect to the union and status of men and women, with respect to the power of speech and education, and concerning commerce and other enterprises. They make men who act in common, who are resourceful, experienced, inquisitive. They also cause men to advance by great expenditures, to be very changeable, not persevering in their activities or intentions for the future.
<These men are> noble in the face of adversity, but are subject to ups and downs in their livelihood.

\Mercury\xspace and \Mars\xspace are not good. They cause hostility, lawsuits, reversals, malice, betrayals, wrongs
from superiors or inferiors. These stars make some men athletic, martial, commanding, beneficent, inquisitive <of the occult>, getting a livelihood in a varied manner. They resort to forgery in order to embezzle, steal, and loot, and having fallen into debt and expenses, they bring on themselves infamy and hot pursuit. If the configuration is afflicted, men meet with accusations and imprisonment, and they suffer
loss or confiscation of goods.

\secbr
\subsection{\textit{[Sun and Moon]}}
The \Sun\xspace and the \Moon\xspace are good. They are productive of associations with the great and of high rank,
as well as possession of estates, property, money, and adornment. These stars cause men to be successful in business enterprises \textbf{/41K/} and to receive profit. If the basis <of the nativity> is found to be great, men become leaders of cities, in charge of affairs, preeminent among the masses, gifted with a very high public image, munificent, governing, ruling, unsurpassed, and possessing a kingly property and spirit. Those starting with a moderate/average fortune become lucky and are called blessed. The good, however, does not last for this type of person, because of the waning configuration of the moon.
