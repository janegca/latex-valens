\section{The Third, Seventh, and Fortieth Days of the Moon (15K, 14P)}
\index{planets!Moon!3rd, 7th, 40th days}
The third, seventh, and fortieth days of the Moon as follows: assume the \Moon\, is in \Scorpio 7\deg; the third day will be in \Sagittarius\, 7\deg. [It is necessary to investigate the day in this way. \Sagittarius\, 7\deg\, has
become the third day.] 

In the nativity chart the seventh will be found in square, at \Aquarius\, 7\deg. The fortieth will be at \Taurus\, 7\deg. (Some add 160\deg to the Moon’s position at birth and count off this amount from the Moon’s sign. Others add to the Moon’s position at birth <its positions> on the third and seventh
and fortieth days, then after calculating, they interpret the Moon at those places.)

In general they note the fortunate, unfortunate, and average nativities according to the third, seventh, and fortieth days: if these locations are beheld by benefics in operative places, and not by malefics, then you can predict exceedingly great good fortune. 

If two of these locations are beheld by benefics and one by malefics, then you can predict average fortune. 

If three are beheld by malefics, with the benefics turned
away, then predict misfortune. If the situation is mixed, say “average.”
