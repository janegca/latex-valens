\index{planets!productive of!reputation}
\index{planets!productive of!sudden danger}
\index{planets!productive of!plots}
\index{planets!productive of!insecure basis}
\Saturn, \Jupiter, and the \Sun\, are unsteady and insecure. <They bring failure> with respect to possessions, friendships, and other business enterprises. They cause loss of possessions, and they cause some to fall into invidious accusations. \textbf{/41P/} These stars, having indicated help from unexpected sources or from legacies, and having increased someone’s reputation, bring ruin and accusation, along with sudden danger and plots. They do cause preeminence, guardianship of others’ business, tax gathering, and salaries, for the sake of which men endure disturbance and crises, but these stars make the basis <of the nativity> insecure and worrisome.

\index{planets!\Saturn-\Jupiter-\Moon}
\index{planets!productive of!rank}
\index{planets!productive of!profit}
\index{planets!productive of!associations with great}
\index{planets!productive of!gifts}
\index{planets!productive of!travel abroad}
\index{planets!productive of!estates}
\index{planets!productive of!ships}
\Saturn, \Jupiter, and the \Moon\, are in harmony, bringing rank and profit, associations with the great, and gifts. Men travel abroad; they succeed in foreign lands or because of foreigners, not only in their own business, but also in others’. Men also derive benefits from women, and coming into possession \textbf{/42K/} of estates and land, they become lords. Some become shipowners and thus increase their livelihood, or they manage their livelihood by getting hold of whatever is involved with water.

\index{planets!\Saturn-\Jupiter-\Mars}

\index{planets!productive of!priesthood}
\index{planets!productive of!influence}

\index{planets!productive of!accusations}
\index{planets!productive of!violence}
\index{planets!productive of!inheritances}
\index{planets!productive of!reputation, low}
\Saturn, \Jupiter, and \Mars\, bring about mixtures of good things. They make some men famous, high priestly, governing, influential, in charge of the masses, of villages, or of military matters, commanding and obeyed. These men are not adorned with great show of wealth; they are involved in reversals, accusations, and violent affrays; and they lead worried lives. <These stars cause> others to be graced with the possession of an income, to be masters of estates and property, and to profit from the deceased, but their reputation is low. \mndl Therefore matters must be interpreted according to the configuration of the heavenly bodies and the effects of the signs.

\index{planets!\Saturn-\Jupiter-\Venus}
\index{planets!productive of!associations}
\index{planets!productive of!advancement}
\index{planets!productive of!legacies}

\index{planets!productive of!unstable marriage}
\index{planets!productive of!embarrassment}
\index{planets!productive of!hositility}
\index{planets!productive of!judgements}
\Saturn, \Jupiter, and \Venus\, are good, helpful in occupations, bringing possessions. They cause associations of male and female, as well as friendships, advancement, and benefits from legacies. However in their associations men are slandered and envied; they are unsteady in their marriages, suffering embarrassments, hostility, and judgements. On the other hand, they are fond of their associates and easy to live with, enjoying many new friendships. They are not entirely tranquil, nor do they lack grief with respect to children and slaves.

\index{planets!productive of!gifts}
\index{planets!productive of!honors}
\index{character!generous}
\index{character!subtle}
\Saturn, \Jupiter, and \Mercury\, when configured together produce vigorous men, \textbf{/42P/} stewards, trustworthy, preeminent among the masses, commanding and obeyed, handlers of money and directors of documents and accounts. Such men have an independent and adaptable nature: sometimes they appear malevolent and wicked, and they will become covetous of others’ property, thievish, and greedy, because of which they will endure upsets and crises, debts and public infamy. Sometimes these men advance because of their success in action and because of their trustworthiness. Then they gain support and are thought worthy of gifts from the great and of honors. Since they have a generous disposition, they will benefit their own family and even others’. They, however, will take part in the mysteries and in esoteric affairs, and in other respects they will inquire into the curious arts and be subtle,  pretending that their character is straightforward.

\index{character!covetous}
\index{planets!productive of!crime}
\textbf{/43K/}\Saturn, \Mars, and the \Sun\, are indicative of forcible, outré, and dangerous matters. These stars make bold men, men of great ambition, wicked atheists, traitors, insubordinate, men who hate their own families, who abandon their own relatives to go with strangers. They are involved in contumely and dangers. They suffer falls from high places or from animals. They are afraid of burns, and are toilsome in their activities. They do not guard what they already have, but desire others’ goods. They profit from crime. If, however, the configuration happens to be military or athletic, they are toilsome, but not unsuccessful.

\index{planets!productive of!crime}
\index{planets!productive of!death, violent}
\Saturn, \Mars, and the \Moon\, cause men to be venturesome in their business enterprises and noble, but ineffective, meeting with reversals and violence. They become in turn violent, reclusive, wicked: they have a plundering and thievish disposition,and become defendants in trials. They experience detention and criminal charges, unless of course the nativity happens to be fond of wrestling or of weapons, in which case the “detention” configuration is fulfilled by the holds <of wrestling>. Some become injured or diseased
and will suffer a violent end.

\index{planets!productive of!crime}
\index{planets!productive of!murder, poison}
\index{planets!productive of!anxiety}
\Saturn, \Mars, and \Venus\, are favorable at the start of actions, friendships, associations. These stars bring profit, high rank, and political associations. Later, however, men are put into a disturbed state, liable to lawsuits arising from some envy/hatred and treachery. Because of this, such men make accusations and they endure hostility from men and women. \textbf{/43P/} They are involved in shameful faults and adultery, and are the object of scandal and denunciation. Some are inclined to unnatural, bisexual vices, and they become accomplices or participants in crime or murder by poison. Then they suffer no ordinary anxiety.

\index{planets!productive of!poverty}
\index{character!atheist}
\index{planets!productive of!imprisonment}
\index{planets!productive of!profit}
\Saturn, \Mars, and \Mercury\, cause crime, treachery, judgements, and alarms. Men go into debts and expenses for the sake of scriptures or mystic lore, and they suffer no ordinary tribulations and ruin. In other cases these stars make men keen and intelligent in business, leading a varied life, \textbf{/44K/} maligned by some because of violent and illegal activities. Occasionally they become involved in toilsome and dangerous business and fall into poverty. Then they blame their own Fortune, blaspheme the gods, and become oath breakers and atheists. If the stars are not in their proper domicile, they bring criminal charges and imprisonment. If the stars do happen to be in their proper, operative places, these men will undertake struggles of behalf of others and will generally prevail, or they will profit from documents, from accounts, or from public office, and will increase their livelihood.

\index{planets!productive of!betrayal}
\index{gender!bi-sexual}
\Saturn, \Venus, and the \Sun\, are indicative of lofty associations, honors, and deeds, and they are the cause of high rank, distinction, and preeminence among the masses. They are unstable with respect to property or other matters, and they involve men in ups and downs: they dissolve friendships, effect the reduction of livelihood, and bring public exposure or punishments arising from the betrayal of females or of religious matters. <They cause men to be> unstable and bisexual in their intercourse and other relationships.

\Saturn, \Venus, and the \Moon\, bring vicissitudes and instability of life, especially with respect to wife, mother, and children. They impose bad manners, ingratitude, as well as jealousy and quarrels, divorces, censure, public exposure, unnatural vices. But in business these men are not without resource, sharp, full of accomplishment, profiting from legacies. They do not however retain this wealth, since they are plotted against by many, and are themselves accomplices in crime and murder by poison, as well as seducers of women.

\index{planets!productive of!poisonings}
\index{planets!productive of!turmoil}
\index{character!insecure}
\Saturn, \Venus, and \Mercury\, make intelligent, clever individuals, shrewd and designing in their business enterprises. These men, however, are unsteady and \textbf{/44P/} frozen in their first enterprises. They become covetous of others’ goods, accomplices in many crimes, seekers of curious lore, flexible, healing, enjoying newness, change, and travel. If, under these conditions, the configuration is afflicted, or if \Mars\, is in aspect from the right, these men fall into disturbances and trials because of poisonings, of females, or because of legacies, or they suffer a loss of livelihood or an afflicting accusation after being wronged by women. In general they will be insecure and pained with respect to women, children, and slaves.\footnote{Combinations of \Saturn-\Mercury-\Sun, \Saturn-\Mercury-\Moon, and \Saturn-\Sun-\Moon\, are missing from the text.}

They are blameworthy, wasting much wealth, generous, wallowing in loans and debts and defaulting, embezzlers of others’ money, seducers, deceiving with their charm, wealthy, malignant—but repenting of what they have done.

\textbf{/48P/}\Mars, the \Sun, and the \Moon\, make bold, manly, reckless, vigorous men. They become athletes and soldiers, rulers and governors, and they make their careers through violent, hateful deeds, in laborious crafts, or in work in hard materials. They fall into reverses and into dangerous situations, and suffer hostility and attacks from the great, but if benefics are in aspect, they maintain the basis <of their nativity> unimpaired.

\Mars, the \Sun, and \Venus\, cause men to have many friends and to be well-known, \textbf{/49K/} to be thought worthy of alliances and honors. These men have many resources, love their associates, but are criticized and gossiped about. Their friendships do not last and their accomplishments are fleeting. They desire much, they spend much, they are wrongers of women, and they are very ready to be insolent. They fall into reverses and hostility through their reckless decisions.

\Mars, the \Sun, and \Mercury\, make men of much experience, inventive in business enterprises. Although careworn and unsuccessful in the goal of their calculations, they prevail unexpectedly. Therefore such men are mentally unstable, reckless, active, hot-tempered; after rushing against their enemies and bringing charges of wrongdoing or damages against them, these men then change their minds.
Occasionally they have a cowardly and despicable character. They control their emotions well, play a part, and yield to men whom they should not yield to. For the most part, they have a livelihood subject to ups and downs. On coming into another’s control, they curse their own Fortune.

\Mars, the \Moon, and \Mercury\, make men skillful and ingenious, easily aroused to action and very vigorous, wanting to act quickly, but being remiss, seekers of curious lore, initiates of the mysteries, and partakers of secret knowledge. They are oppressors, violent, insubordinate, covetous, falling into accusations and suits for damages, into trials and dangers, and they experience alarms because of documents and money. However, these stars do make men wealthy and lavish, although failing in their livelihood. 

\textbf{/49P/} This then is what we have explained with respect to the distinctive characteristics of individual stars as well as several taken together. If other stars share the configuration (being in conjunction or in aspect), the reading of the horoscope will be changed according to the nature of the additional star. However I did not want to continue writing at length about such additional factors, because the old astrologers have expounded them already.

\index{planets!predicting effects}
The particular effects of the natural influence of each star and sign will be obvious at once to anyone who pays attention. (These have been explained previously in our treatise.) Therefore it will be necessary to determine how each star is configured in relation to the others: 
\begin{itemize}
\item is it at an angle or rising? 
\item is it the ruler of a lot, of the Ascendant, or of a triangle? 
\item likewise with the sign in which the star appears: 
\begin{itemize}
\item is it of its own or of another sect, and 
\item which \textbf{/50K/} other signs does it have in aspect? 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

If these things are determined, the predictions will be solidly based. 

If <stars> fall in inoperative places, the <level of> occupation and of Fortune will be less\footnote{Schmidt translates this line as ``If the planets should fall amiss in unprofitable places, the effects of their activity and the effects of fortune will be less'' (VRS1 p60). Presumably what is being referred to are the places averse to the Ascendant, the 2nd, 6th, 8th, and 12th houses and possibly the 3rd which is sometimes considered to be unprofitable.}.
