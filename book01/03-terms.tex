\item[\Mercury]

misfortune is generally true of \Virgo, especially in this term and in that of \Venus. This term causes men who are open to criticism; the term of \Venus\, causes those who err constantly. \textbf{/16K/} They fall conspicuously short in regard to boys.

\item[\Jupiter]

\item[\Venus]
	[7-10] lucky in marriage, pious, loved by everyone, loving children, wealthy, selected for every office, living graciously
\item[\Mercury]
	[11-18] military, competitive, prize winning, and, where words are concerned, bitter, contentious, not to be despised. These degrees are also prolific and fecund. In general they plan mischief, especially against those who attempt evil or do it.
\item[\Jupiter]
	[19-23] talented, lucky, high-priestly, glorified in gold, purple, and the high offices appropriate to the inherent greatness of the nativity. This term is beneficent and as a whole loves men and gods
\item[\Saturn]

\item[\Mars]
	[26-29] hot, rash, violent, shameless, \textbf{/17P/} destructive—except that this term is restless in all things.
