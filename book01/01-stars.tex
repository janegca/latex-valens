\subsection{\textit{[General Indications]}}
\mndl[0.2cm]
The \index{planets!benefic} benefic stars  which are appropriately and favorably situated bring about their proper effects according to their own nature and the nature of their sign, with the aspects and conjunctions of each star being blended. If however they are unfavorably situated, they are indicative of reversals. 

\mnmb[0.2cm] 
In the same way even the \index{planets!malefic} malefic stars, when they are operative in appropriate places in their own sect, are bestowers of good and indicative of the greatest positions and success; when they are inoperative, they bring about disasters and accusations.

\mnm[0.2cm]
\ldots Each star is the ruler of its own “element” in the universe with reference to <the stars’> sympathy or
antipathy or mutual influence. Their <aspects> are blended according the their “applications” or
“separations,” their “superior aspects” or “blockages,” their “attendance,” their “ray-shooting,” or the
“approach” of their masters. \\
\\
The Moon becomes the ruler of foresight. \\
The Sun the ruler of light. \\
Saturn the ruler of ignorance and necessity. \\
Jupiter the ruler of rank, crowns and zeal. \\
Mars becomes the ruler of action and effort. \\
Venus the ruler of love, desire, and beauty. \\
Mercury  the ruler of law, friendship, and trust. 

These stars have their own effects\ldots.

Now that these matters have been settled, the nature of the twelve signs must be mentioned.
