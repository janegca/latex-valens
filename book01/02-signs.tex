\marginnote{\tiny{Aries} \Aries}[0.2cm]
Aries is the house of Mars, a masculine sign, tropic, terrestrial, governing, fiery, free, upward-trending,
semi-vocal, noble, changeable, procuratorial, public, civic, with few offspring, servile, the Midheaven\footnote{Reference is to the \href{http://planetwavesweekly.com/dadatemp/1832374392.html}{Thema Mundi} where Aries is on the MC and Cancer on the the Ascendant (VRS Book 1, p8)} of the universe and the cause of rank, two-toned (since the Sun and the Moon make white lichen). It is also unaspected and ecliptic. 

\mndl[0.2cm]
Depending on its relationship with the houseruler, men born under this sign will be brilliant, distinguished, authoritarian, just, hard on offenders, free, governing, bold in thought, boastful, great-hearted, restless, unstable, haughty, inflated, intimidating, \textbf{/6K/} quickly changing, wealthy. 

\mndl[0.2cm]
When the houserulers are favorably situated and have benefics in aspect, kings and powerful men are born, those
having the say over life and death.

\textbf{Climate:} \textbf{/6P/} Aries is by nature watery, with thunder and hail. From its first degree to the equinox, it is stormy, full of hail, windy, destructive. The middle degrees up to 15\deg are mild <and fruitful; the following degrees are hot and cause plagues> of animals. 

\textbf{Fixed Stars:} This sign has 19 bright stars. On the belt are 14 bright stars, 27 dim, 28 somewhat bright, and 48 faint. 

\textbf{Paranatellonta:} The constellations that rise at the same time as Aries are (in the north) the first part of Perseus, and the rear and the left parts of Auriga, and (in the south) the fin and
tail of Cetus. <When Aries is rising,> the feet of Bootes (in the north) and the hind parts of Lupus (in the south) are setting.

\textbf{Zones:} The following zones are subject to Aries: 
\begin{itemize}
\item to the front parts, Babylon; 
\item to the head, Elymais;

Taurus is feminine, solid, lying in the sun’s spring tropic, full of bones, with some limbs missing, rising backwards, setting straight down. 

\textbf{Climate:} This sign lies for the most part in the invisible sky. It is calm. From its first degree to 6\deg (the section of the Pleiades) it is worthless, even destructive, disease-producing,thundering, causing earthquakes and lightning flashes. The next two degrees are fiery and smokey. The right part (toward Auriga) is temperate and cool. The left parts are worthless and changeable, sometimes chilling, at other times heating. The head (to 23\deg) is in a temperate atmosphere, but it causes disease and death for living things. The rest is destructive, worthless, disease-ridden.

\textbf{Fixed Stars:} It has 27 stars. \textbf{/7K/}

\textbf{Paranatellonta:} The constellations that rise with it are (in the north) the rear of Auriga and (in the south) the rear of Cetus and the first section of Eridanus. Venus, the moon, Ceres, <Vesta,> Mars, and Mercury. The constellations that set <when Taurus is rising> are (in the north) Bootes up to the belt and the leg of Ophiouchus up to the knees. In the south Orion rises with Taurus; he is belted around the waist,
extends his sword in his right hand, \textbf{/7P/} and holds in his left hand the so-called caduceus.

This sign is productive of order, earthy, rustic, related to farming, a freedman, downward-trending, with few offspring, semi-vocal and mute, noble, invariable, energetic, unfinished, indicative of estates and possessions. 

The ecliptic lies to the north, rising in line with its <Taurus’> highest point. Men born under this sign are noble, energetic, toilsome, good at keeping things, pleasure-loving, music-loving, generous. Some are laborers, propagators, planters. 

If benefics incline toward this place or if the houseruler is favorably situated, men become priests and school superintendants, as well as those judged worthy of crowns and of the purple, of monuments and statues; also supervisors of temples and distinguished and brilliant individuals.
