\index{signs!Pisces} Pisces is the celestial sign which is \index{signs!feminine} feminine, \index{signs!watery} moist, quite wet, \index{signs!bicorporeal} bicorporeal, with many offspring, mossy, scaley, sinewy, humpbacked, leprous, \index{signs!bicorporeal} two-formed, \index{signs!mute} mute, motile, with rough skin, in conflict with itself because one Fish is northern, the other southern. It is moist, downward-trending, \index{signs!servile} servile, changeable, with many offspring, bicorporeal, sociable/lewd, with some limbs missing, the cause of wandering, varied.

Men born under this sign are unsteady, unreliable, changing from bad fortune to good, sexy, thievish, shameless, prolific, popular.

\textbf{Climate:} As a whole, Pisces is cool and breezy. By parts it is as follows: the first parts are temperate, the
middle moist, the last destructive and worthless. 

\textbf{Fixed Stars:} It has…stars. 

\textbf{Paranatellonta:} In the north the rest of Andromeda rises with Pisces, as well as the rest of Perseus—the parts on the right—and Triangulum in Aries. In the south the head of the Southern Fish rises. Neptune\footnote{The god, not the planet.}, \textbf{/13P/} Mars, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter. In the south Ara and the rest of Hydra set <when Pisces is rising>; in the north, nothing. Pisces lies toward the north wind. It also lies toward the zone of the Red Sea, having not a few
islands under its control, above which lie India and the so-called Indian Ocean. In its eastern parts Pisces touches Parthia, the land of the Indies, and the Eastern Ocean; in its northern parts, Scythia. In its western parts it washes with its waves Myosormos, Orthosormos, and the surrounding cities.
According to the Sphaerica, Aquila, cut off by the north pole, and part of Sagitta lie to the north of Pisces, not far away from the north pole. The so-called Pegasus is within the Arctic pole. (The Arctic Circle, lying in the middle of the universe, stands apart from the other divisions <of the sky>. It has in it the Great Bear (called Cynosura) stretching from the north toward the east, and from the south the other Bear, called the Lesser, \textbf{/14K/} which rises at midnight, and which the so–called Bearguard <Bootes> controls, having a rein on both Bears. He is invisible depending on the elevation of the two Bears. One looks north, the other south.) 

\textbf{Zones:} The following zones are subject to Pisces: 
\begin{itemize}
\item to the front, the Euphrates and the Tigris; 
\item to the middle, Syria and the Red Sea, India, mid-Persis and the neighboring lands; 
\item to the tail, the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, and the Borysthenes river; 
\item to the tie of the Northern Fish, Thrace; 
\item to that of the Southern Fish, Asia, Sardinia.
\end{itemize}
